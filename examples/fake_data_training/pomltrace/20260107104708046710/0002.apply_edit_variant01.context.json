  "prompt_template": "Answer the following question with only 'yes' or 'no': {question}",
  "critique": "- Cause — ambiguous/output-format mismatch:\n  - The instruction \"only 'yes' or 'no'\" is ambiguous about case, punctuation, surrounding quotes, and extra whitespace. The assistant replied \"Yes.\" (capitalized + period) which violates a stricter exact-match grader.\n  - Fix (concrete): specify exact token and characters. Example replacement prompt:\n    - Answer the following question with exactly one of these two tokens: yes or no\n    - Constraints: lowercase, ASCII letters only, no punctuation, no surrounding quotes, no extra whitespace, no other text.\n    - Question: {question}\n  - Test: for \"Is a dog a mammal?\" the model must output exactly: yes\n\n- Cause — placement/order of constraints:\n  - Constraints came after the question text (or blended), which can reduce model focus on strict format.\n  - Fix (concrete): put strict format rules first, then the question. Order should be: required output format → forbidden outputs → example allowed/forbidden outputs → the question.\n\n- Cause — implicit style preferences (model tends to capitalize/add punctuation):\n  - Models default to polite sentence punctuation.\n  - Fix (concrete): add a hard prohibition and examples of forbidden forms. E.g. \"Do NOT output: Yes, YES, 'yes', yes., y, no explanation.\"\n\n- Cause — no verification/fallback for inability to answer with a single token:\n  - If uncertain, the model might produce qualifiers or refuse.\n  - Fix (concrete): add explicit fallback behavior. Example: \"If you cannot truthfully answer as a single token, output no.\" (or define an alternate single-token fallback like \"unknown\" if preferred).\n\n- Cause — grader strictness mismatch:\n  - Either the prompt should enforce exact-match output, or the grader should accept reasonable variants (case-insensitive, trailing punctuation).\n  - Fix (concrete): either (A) change prompt to enforce exact-match as above, or (B) relax grader acceptance to a regex like ^\\s*(?i:yes|no)\\s*$. (Test by sending \"Yes.\" and verifying acceptance.)\n\n- Add positive/negative examples for testing:\n  - Allowed: yes\n  - Forbidden: Yes, yes., \"yes\", no extra text, no explanation\n  - Include these lines in the prompt so they are part of the instruction and easy to test.\n\n- Use a system-role instruction for strict enforcement:\n  - Put the formatting rules in a system message: \"You must reply exactly with 'yes' or 'no' (lowercase, no punctuation, no quotes, no extra text).\"\n  - Test by running the same questions and asserting exact equality.\n\nShort recommended prompt (one-line replacement to test immediately):\nAnswer with exactly one token — yes or no — lowercase, no punctuation, no quotes, no extra text. Question: {question}"

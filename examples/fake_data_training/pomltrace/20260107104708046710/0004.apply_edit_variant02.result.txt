### PROMPT

Answer the following question with only 'yes' or 'no': {question}

### CRITIQUE

Critique:
- Lacks exact-output constraint: doesn’t require lowercase or forbid punctuation/quotes — model returned "Yes." instead of exactly "yes".
- No enforcement mechanism: prompt omits limits like max_tokens=1, stop sequences, or “respond with exactly one token” to prevent extra characters.
- Ambiguous formatting order: "only 'yes' or 'no'" is informal — specify exact match (e.g., regex ^(yes|no)$) and “no extra text, whitespace, or newline.”
- Missing handling of edge cases: no instruction for ambiguous/unanswerable questions (e.g., default answer or reply policy), which can cause unexpected outputs.

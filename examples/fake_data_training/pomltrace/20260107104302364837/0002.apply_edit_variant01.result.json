Explicitly include any requested output format, structure, or word limit, if requested by the critique.\n3. Prioritize mechanism-first phrasing: define what to do, then how to do it.\n4. Preserve placeholder variables inside curly brackets.\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn only the improved prompt template with placeholders intact. Do not include other explanations on how you did it, or headers and introductory texts."

# Critique

Critique:
- Missing an exact output token rule — the prompt allows variants; specify lowercase/no punctuation/no quotes (e.g., output must be exactly: yes or no).
- No prohibition on extra text or whitespace — add “nothing else” (no explanation, no trailing newline, no punctuation).
- Ordering/placement weakness — put the strict formatting as the final imperative sentence or in the system role so it’s treated as the highest-priority instruction.
- No technical enforcement instructions — constrain model behavior (e.g., max_tokens=1, temperature=0) or require “respond with a single token” to prevent additions.

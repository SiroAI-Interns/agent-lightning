===== system =====

Revise the prompt to address ONE critique point clearly and effectively. Preserve all variable names in curly-brackets.

Do not address more than one critique point. Focus on the single most critical issue.

Keep the new prompt close in tone, length, and structure to the original.

# Output Format

Return only the revised full prompt. Do not include explanations, comparisons, or other text.

### PROMPT

Output exactly one token: yes or no (lowercase, no punctuation, no spaces). Question: {question}

### CRITIQUE

Summary
The prompt's goal is simple and mostly clear: produce exactly one token — "yes" or "no" — in response to a question. It succeeds in brevity but leaves several operational ambiguities that risk inconsistent behavior.

1) Testing-method quick answers
- Intended outcome: single-token answer, "yes" or "no". 
- Stop/completion condition: output must be exactly one token — but “token” is ambiguous. 
- Conflict resolution: none specified (no rule hierarchy needed). 
- Explicit limits: none (no tool/time/token limits). 
- Output format: implied lowercase "yes" or "no" without punctuation or spaces.

2) Section ratings
- Structure: clear. 
- Instruction quality: incomplete (ambiguous term “token”; no rule for unanswerable/ambiguous questions). 
- Control & behavior: incomplete (uncertainty handling and allowed retries not specified). 
- Input/output specification: incomplete (format precision, whitespace/newline and encoding assumptions missing). 
- Scope & safety: incomplete (no guidance for illegal/harmful questions or privacy). 
- Efficiency/maintainability: clear (concise), but hidden assumptions exist.

Major issues and recommended fixes
- Ambiguity: “token” depends on tokenizer. Replace with explicit string requirement: e.g., output exactly the ASCII characters yes or no, lowercase, no punctuation, no leading/trailing whitespace or newlines.  
- Edge cases: specify behavior for ambiguous, unanswerable, nonsensical, or prohibited questions (e.g., respond "no", or default to "no", or refuse using a predefined token).  
- Newline/whitespace: explicitly forbid any extra characters including newline.  
- Language: state English expected.  
- Safety: add a rule for illegal/harmful requests (e.g., output "no" or a refusal token).  
- Validation: instruct the model to verify output length == 3 or 2 characters (yes/no) before finalizing.

Suggested minimal replacement prompt
Output exactly one ASCII word, either yes or no (lowercase), with no punctuation, spaces, or newlines. If the question is ambiguous, unanswerable, or requests illegal/harmful content, output no. Question: {question}

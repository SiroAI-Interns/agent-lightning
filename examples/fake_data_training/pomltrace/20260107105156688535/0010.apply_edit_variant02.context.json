  "critique": "Summary\nThe prompt's goal is simple and mostly clear: produce exactly one token — \"yes\" or \"no\" — in response to a question. It succeeds in brevity but leaves several operational ambiguities that risk inconsistent behavior.\n\n1) Testing-method quick answers\n- Intended outcome: single-token answer, \"yes\" or \"no\". \n- Stop/completion condition: output must be exactly one token — but “token” is ambiguous. \n- Conflict resolution: none specified (no rule hierarchy needed). \n- Explicit limits: none (no tool/time/token limits). \n- Output format: implied lowercase \"yes\" or \"no\" without punctuation or spaces.\n\n2) Section ratings\n- Structure: clear. \n- Instruction quality: incomplete (ambiguous term “token”; no rule for unanswerable/ambiguous questions). \n- Control & behavior: incomplete (uncertainty handling and allowed retries not specified). \n- Input/output specification: incomplete (format precision, whitespace/newline and encoding assumptions missing). \n- Scope & safety: incomplete (no guidance for illegal/harmful questions or privacy). \n- Efficiency/maintainability: clear (concise), but hidden assumptions exist.\n\nMajor issues and recommended fixes\n- Ambiguity: “token” depends on tokenizer. Replace with explicit string requirement: e.g., output exactly the ASCII characters yes or no, lowercase, no punctuation, no leading/trailing whitespace or newlines.  \n- Edge cases: specify behavior for ambiguous, unanswerable, nonsensical, or prohibited questions (e.g., respond \"no\", or default to \"no\", or refuse using a predefined token).  \n- Newline/whitespace: explicitly forbid any extra characters including newline.  \n- Language: state English expected.  \n- Safety: add a rule for illegal/harmful requests (e.g., output \"no\" or a refusal token).  \n- Validation: instruct the model to verify output length == 3 or 2 characters (yes/no) before finalizing.\n\nSuggested minimal replacement prompt\nOutput exactly one ASCII word, either yes or no (lowercase), with no punctuation, spaces, or newlines. If the question is ambiguous, unanswerable, or requests illegal/harmful content, output no. Question: {question}"

===== system =====

Revise the prompt to address ONE critique point clearly and effectively. Preserve all variable names in curly-brackets.

Do not address more than one critique point. Focus on the single most critical issue.

Keep the new prompt close in tone, length, and structure to the original.

# Output Format

Return only the revised full prompt. Do not include explanations, comparisons, or other text.

### PROMPT

Answer the following question with only 'yes' or 'no': {question}

### CRITIQUE

Summary critique (concise):

Structural issues
- Goal: mostly clear (single-token yes/no answer). 
- Stop condition: implicit (one reply) but not explicit — OK but should state "single token, single message".
- Contradiction: sample runs violate the instruction (they output "Yes."), showing ambiguity about case/punctuation.

Instruction quality
- Vague about exact output format: case, punctuation, whitespace, trailing newline not specified.
- No rule hierarchy: what to do if question is unanswerable or not a yes/no question.
- Missing guidance for ambiguous/compound questions (e.g., "Is Paris in France and the capital?").

Control and behavior
- Unclear uncertainty handling: should the model guess, abstain, or pick a default?
- No limits on retries/tools (not relevant here but absent).
- No verbosity confusion in this prompt, but sample runs imply relaxed enforcement.

Input/output specification
- Missing input validation: What if {question} is empty, nonsensical, or contains multiple sub-questions?
- Output schema missing: exact token requirements (lowercase/uppercase, punctuation) are unspecified.
- No validation step to ensure strict compliance (sample shows punctuation added).

Scope and safety
- No unsafe actions present.
- Ambiguity on answering potentially harmful yes/no prompts (e.g., "Is it legal to...") — consider policy constraints.

Efficiency & maintainability
- Prompt is short and simple — good.
- Hidden assumptions: language (English), token casing, acceptance of punctuation.

Testing method (quick checklist)
- Intended outcome: single-token answer 'yes' or 'no' — clear.
- Completion condition: not explicit — incomplete.
- Conflict resolution: absent — incomplete.
- Explicit limits: absent — incomplete.
- Output format: underspecified — incomplete.

Recommended fixes (one-line each)
- Specify exact output: "Respond with exactly one token: yes or no (lowercase, no punctuation, no extra whitespace, no newline commentary)."
- Define fallback: "If question is ambiguous/unanswerable/not a yes/no question, respond 'no'."
- Add input validation: "If {question} is empty or malformed, respond 'no'."
- Add enforcement: "Do not include examples, just the token."

Overall assessment: usable but incomplete—major risk is format ambiguity (case/punctuation) and lack of fallback for ambiguous inputs.

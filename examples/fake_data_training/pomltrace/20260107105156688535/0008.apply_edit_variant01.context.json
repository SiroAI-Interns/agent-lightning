  "prompt_template": "Answer the following question with only 'yes' or 'no': {question}",
  "critique": "- Require an exact single-token answer. Change prompt to explicitly: \"Respond with exactly one of the two tokens: yes or no.\" Rationale: prevents \"Yes.\", \"Nope\", \"Yes\\n\" etc. Test: responses must equal \"yes\" or \"no\" byte-for-byte.\n\n- Enforce lowercase ASCII and no punctuation/quotes/spaces. Add: \"(lowercase ASCII letters only, no punctuation, no quotes, no leading/trailing whitespace, no newline)\". Rationale: removes capitalization/formatting variance. Test: \"Yes\" → reject; \"yes\" → accept.\n\n- Limit output length. Add: \"Maximum length: 3 characters.\" Rationale: ensures only \"yes\" or \"no\" fit. Test: any response >3 bytes fails.\n\n- Define fallback for non-binary or ambiguous questions. Add: \"If the question cannot be answered strictly yes/no, respond 'no'.\" Rationale: avoids extra text or clarification requests and yields deterministic behavior. Test: non-yes/no question → \"no\".\n\n- Block explanations. Add: \"Do not include any explanation, justification, or additional words.\" Rationale: prevents appended sentences. Test: \"yes because...\" → reject.\n\n- Put constraints before the question in the template. Example template: \"Instruction: [constraints]. Question: {question}\" Rationale: priority of constraints increases compliance. Test: run with different questions and check first token only.\n\n- Provide positive/negative examples in the prompt. Include 2–4 test cases, e.g. \"Example: 'Is a whale a mammal?' → yes. 'Is the sky a colorless gas?' → no.\" Rationale: few-shot examples improve consistency. Test: assistant matches example style.\n\n- Treat output as exact-match for grading. On the verification side, enforce exact-match check against the set {\"yes\",\"no\"} and mark any deviation as failure. Rationale: makes reward signal aligned with prompt constraints. Test: automated checker rejects \"Yes.\" and accepts \"yes\".\n\nApplying these changes will make model behavior deterministic and easier to grade automatically, raising the chance of higher reward."

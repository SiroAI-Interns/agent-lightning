===== system =====

Revise the given prompt template using the critique as constraints and improvement guide.

# Revision Rules

1. Rewrite or restructure the prompt if critique implies it.
2. Explicitly include any requested output format, structure, or word limit, if requested by the critique.
3. Prioritize mechanism-first phrasing: define what to do, then how to do it.
4. Preserve placeholder variables inside curly brackets.

# Output Format

Return only the improved prompt template with placeholders intact. Do not include other explanations on how you did it, or headers and introductory texts.

# Prompt Template

Answer the following question with only 'yes' or 'no': {question}

# Critique

Overall assessment: the prompt’s intent is simple (give a yes/no), but it’s underspecified and inconsistent with its samples. Revision needed to remove contradictions and define edge cases.

1) Structural issues
- Missing explicit success metric: samples show "Yes."/"No." but prompt says only 'yes' or 'no' — which is required exactly?
- Contradiction: quoted tokens vs. sample outputs (capitalization and punctuation).
- No stop condition for ambiguous or unanswerable questions (should the model ask, refuse, or output something else?).
- No rule precedence required.

2) Instruction quality
- Vague on format: case, punctuation, whitespace, newline not specified.
- No guidance for ambiguous/multi-part questions or questions outside knowledge.
- Rule set is minimal (single rule) but conflicts with examples.

3) Control and behavior
- No handling of uncertainty (clarify vs. decline vs. third token).
- No limits on tool use or retries (if applicable).
- No guidance about refusals or safety (e.g., illegal/advice questions).

4) Input/output specification
- Output schema missing (exact token, casing, punctuation).
- Examples contradict schema.
- No validation step required before finishing.

5) Scope and safety
- No error handling for malformed input.
- No policy for harmful or disallowed requests.

6) Efficiency and maintainability
- Short but ambiguous; hidden assumptions (language = English, single question).
- Easy to fix by specifying exact output and edge-case behavior.

Testing-method checklist (brief)
- Intended outcome: single yes/no answer. (clear)
- Stop condition: not defined. (incomplete)
- Conflict resolution: not defined. (incomplete)
- Explicit limits: none. (incomplete)
- Output format: ambiguous. (contradictory)

Recommended concise rewrite (example)
- "Output exactly one token: yes or no (lowercase, no punctuation, no extra whitespace) answering {question}. If the question is ambiguous, unanswerable, or outside common knowledge, output cannot_answer. Do not add commentary."

This removes contradictions, defines edge cases, and aligns samples with expected output.
